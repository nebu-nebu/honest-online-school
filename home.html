							<h2 class="">Marketing Analysis </h2>
							<div class="atf-sec_icon"><span></span><span class="atf-sec_radius"></span><span></span></div>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">This is the part where we determine the economic viability of the project.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">As of 2019, there are more than 31,000 elearning companies in the US. The market capitalization of the elearning industry was 144 billion USD in 2019. It has been growing ever since at a rate of 14.4% annually and is expected to be worth more than 370 billion USD by 2025.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">If you want to start your own e-learning business pdf, you’ll need to come up with an innovative approach. However, the COVID situation has made things easier. People now prefer to learn via elearning rather than attending an actual school.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">One of the most profitable customer bases for any e learning business model are small to medium enterprises. These companies want to get their employees trained at the lowest possible cost. That is only possible through elearning. This enables the employees to receive training while they are in the office and they do not have to take a leave for it.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">Another thing that you need to take care of while planning to start an elearning business is the availability of teachers. If you want to succeed as a new entrant in the industry, you’ll need to hire the best teachers. The best teachers and trainers in the territory are the people who can make the business a success for you.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">You also need to look into the way others in the same industry are operating. The way they teach, examine, and certify their students are some of the very important things to get inspiration from.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3 class="">Market Trends</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">As stated earlier there are more than 31,000 elearning businesses in the US. The market, however, has not always been like this. There were only a handful of distant learning companies operating in the US before the widespread use of the internet. These companies taught through distant lectures on dedicated TV channels and conducted examinations in large cities.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="">Since the 2000s, the industry started to bloom. It had a growth rate of 7% in 2002. The number and magnitude of elearning businesses kept going up and the growth rate accelerated over the years. The industry still has a 14.4% growth rate meaning that new entrants still have a chance.</p>
